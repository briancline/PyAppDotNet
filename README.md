PyAppDotNet
===========

An python library for interacting with the AppDotNet API

Currently very much in progress.
* There are methods for authentication.
* The 'User' section of the API has complete coverage.
* The 'Post' section of the API also has complete coverage.

Do not consider any of this stable, including
the names, as everything is likely to change.

Known Issues
============
* You can't yet specify links in a post except for including the url in the post. Once I figure out how to properly send that information to the API I'll fix that.
* Annotations don't really seem to be working in the API so just pretend they are not there yet.
